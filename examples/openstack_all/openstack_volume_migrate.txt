usage: openstack volume migrate [-h] --host <host> [--force-host-copy]
                                [--lock-volume]
                                <volume>

Migrate volume to a new host

positional arguments:
  <volume>           Volume to migrate (name or ID)

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --host <host>      Destination host (takes the form: host@backend-name#pool)
  --force-host-copy  Enable generic host-based force-migration, which bypasses
                     driver optimizations
  --lock-volume      If specified, the volume state will be locked and will
                     not allow a migration to be aborted (possibly by another
                     operation)
