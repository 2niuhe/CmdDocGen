Scale server to a new flavor. A resize operation is implemented by creating a
new server and copying the contents of the original disk into a new one. It is
a two-step process for the user: the first step is to perform the resize, and
the second step is to either confirm (verify) success and release the old
server or to declare a revert to release the new server and restart the old
one.
