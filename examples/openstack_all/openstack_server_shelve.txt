usage: openstack server shelve [-h] [--offload] [--wait]
                               <server> [<server> ...]

Shelve and optionally offload server(s). Shelving a server creates a snapshot
of the server and stores this snapshot before shutting down the server. This
shelved server can then be offloaded or deleted from the host, freeing up
remaining resources on the host, such as network interfaces. Shelved servers
can be unshelved, restoring the server from the snapshot. Shelving is
therefore useful where users wish to retain the UUID and IP of a server,
without utilizing other resources or disks. Most clouds are configured to
automatically offload shelved servers immediately or after a small delay. For
clouds where this is not configured, or where the delay is larger, offloading
can be manually specified. This is an admin-only operation by default.

positional arguments:
  <server>    Server(s) to shelve (name or ID)

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --offload   Remove the shelved server(s) from the host (admin only).
              Invoking this option on an unshelved server(s) will result in
              the server being shelved first
  --wait      Wait for shelve and/or offload operation to complete
