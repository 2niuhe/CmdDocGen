                                <server>

Migrate server to different host. A migrate operation is implemented as a
resize operation using the same flavor as the old server. This means that,
like resize, migrate works by creating a new server using the same flavor and
copying the contents of the original disk into a new one. As with resize, the
migrate operation is a two-step process for the user: the first step is to
perform the migrate, and the second step is to either confirm (verify) success
and release the old server, or to declare a revert to release the new server
and restart the old one.

positional arguments:

  --live-migration      Live migrate the server; use the ``--host`` option to
                        specify a target host for the migration which will be
                        validated by the scheduler
  --host <hostname>     Migrate the server to the specified host. (supported
                        with --os-compute-api-version 2.30 or above when used
                        with the --live-migration option) (supported with
                        --os-compute-api-version 2.56 or above when used
                        without the --live-migration option)
  --shared-migration    Perform a shared live migration (default before --os-
                        compute-api-version 2.25, auto after)
  --block-migration     Perform a block live migration (auto-configured from
                        --os-compute-api-version 2.25)
  --disk-overcommit     Allow disk over-commit on the destination host
                        (supported with --os-compute-api-version 2.24 or
                        below)
  --no-disk-overcommit  Do not over-commit disk on the destination host
                        (default) (supported with --os-compute-api-version
