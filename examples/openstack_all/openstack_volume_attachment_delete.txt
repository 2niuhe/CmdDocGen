usage: openstack volume attachment delete [-h] <attachment>

Delete an attachment for a volume. Similarly to the 'volume attachment create'
command, this command will only delete the volume attachment record in the
Volume service. It will not invoke the necessary Compute service actions to
actually attach the volume to the server at the hypervisor level. As a result,
it should typically only be used for troubleshooting issues with an existing
server in combination with other tooling. For all other use cases, the 'server
volume remove' command should be preferred.

positional arguments:
  <attachment>  ID of volume attachment to delete

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
Could not clean up: 'ClientManager' object has no attribute 'session'
