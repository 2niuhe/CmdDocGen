usage: openstack server evacuate [-h] [-f {json,shell,table,value,yaml}]
                                 [-c COLUMN] [--noindent] [--prefix PREFIX]
                                 [--max-width <integer>] [--fit-width]
                                 [--print-empty] [--wait] [--host <host>]
                                 [--password <password> | --shared-storage]
                                 <server>

Evacuate a server to a different host. This command is used to recreate a
server after the host it was on has failed. It can only be used if the compute
service that manages the server is down. This command should only be used by
an admin after they have confirmed that the instance is not running on the
failed host. If the server instance was created with an ephemeral root disk on
non-shared storage the server will be rebuilt using the original glance image
preserving the ports and any attached data volumes. If the server uses boot
for volume or has its root disk on shared storage the root disk will be
preserved and reused for the evacuated instance on the new host.

positional arguments:
  <server>              Server (name or ID)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --wait                Wait for evacuation to complete
  --host <host>         Set the preferred host on which to rebuild the
                        evacuated server. The host will be validated by the
                        scheduler. (supported by --os-compute-api-version 2.29
                        or above)
  --password <password>
                        Set the password on the evacuated instance. This
                        option is mutually exclusive with the --shared-storage
                        option. This option requires cloud support.
  --shared-storage      Indicate that the instance is on shared storage. This
                        will be auto-calculated with --os-compute-api-version
                        2.14 and greater and should not be used with later
                        microversions. This option is mutually exclusive with
                        the --password option

output formatters:
  output formatter options

  -f {json,shell,table,value,yaml}, --format {json,shell,table,value,yaml}
                        the output format, defaults to table
  -c COLUMN, --column COLUMN
                        specify the column(s) to include, can be repeated to
                        show multiple columns

json formatter:
  --noindent            whether to disable indenting the JSON

shell formatter:
  a format a UNIX shell can parse (variable="value")

  --prefix PREFIX       add a prefix to all variable names

table formatter:
  --max-width <integer>
                        Maximum display width, <1 to disable. You can also use
                        the CLIFF_MAX_TERM_WIDTH environment variable, but the
                        parameter takes precedence.
  --fit-width           Fit the table to the display width. Implied if --max-
                        width greater than 0. Set the environment variable
                        CLIFF_FIT_WIDTH=1 to always enable
  --print-empty         Print empty table if there is no data to show.
