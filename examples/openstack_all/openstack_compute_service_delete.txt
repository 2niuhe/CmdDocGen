usage: openstack compute service delete [-h] <service> [<service> ...]

Delete compute service(s)

positional arguments:
  <service>   Compute service(s) to delete (ID only). If using ``--os-compute-
              api-version`` 2.53 or greater, the ID is a UUID which can be
              retrieved by listing compute services using the same 2.53+
              microversion. If deleting a compute service, be sure to stop the
              actual compute process on the physical host before deleting the
              service with this command. Failing to do so can lead to the
              running service re-creating orphaned compute_nodes table records
              in the database.
