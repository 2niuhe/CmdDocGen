# Command: cinder help consisgroup-delete

usage: cinder consisgroup-delete [--force]
                                 <consistencygroup> [<consistencygroup> ...]

Removes one or more consistency groups.

Positional Arguments:
  <consistencygroup>  Name or ID of one or more consistency groups to be
                      deleted.

Options:
  --force             Allows or disallows consistency groups to be deleted. If
                      the consistency group is empty, it can be deleted
                      without the force flag. If the consistency group is not
                      empty, the force flag is required for it to be deleted.
