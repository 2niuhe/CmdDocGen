                        This is mutually exclusive with --name and takes
                        priority. Default=None.
  --name <name>         Use the name for new volume creation to restore. This
                        is mutually exclusive with --volume and --volume takes
                        priority. Default=None.

                        Volume type for the new volume creation to restore.
                        This option is not valid when used with the "volume"
                        option. Default=None. (Supported by API version 3.47

                        valid when used with the "volume" option.
