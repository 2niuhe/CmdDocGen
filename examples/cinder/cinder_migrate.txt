# Command: cinder help migrate

usage: cinder migrate [--force-host-copy [<True|False>]]
                      [--lock-volume [<True|False>]] [--cluster CLUSTER]
                      <volume> [<host>]

Migrates volume to a new host.

Positional Arguments:
  <volume>              ID of volume to migrate.
  <host>                Destination host. Takes the form: host@backend-
                        name#pool

Options:
  --force-host-copy [<True|False>]
                        Enables or disables generic host-based force-
                        migration, which bypasses driver optimizations.
                        Default=False.
  --lock-volume [<True|False>]
                        Enables or disables the termination of volume
                        migration caused by other commands. This option
                        applies to the available volume. True means it locks
                        the volume state and does not allow the migration to
                        be aborted. The volume status will be in maintenance
                        during the migration. False means it allows the volume
                        migration to be aborted. The volume status is still in
                        the original status. Default=False.
  --cluster CLUSTER     Destination cluster. Takes the form: cluster@backend-
                        name#pool (Supported by API version 3.16 and later)
