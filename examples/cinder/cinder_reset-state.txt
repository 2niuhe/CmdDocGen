# Command: cinder help reset-state

usage: cinder reset-state [--type <type>] [--state <state>]
                          [--attach-status <attach-status>]
                          [--reset-migration-status]
                          <entity> [<entity> ...]

Explicitly updates the entity state in the Cinder database. Being a database
change only, this has no impact on the true state of the entity and may not
match the actual state. This can render a entity unusable in the case of
changing to the 'available' state.

Positional Arguments:
  <entity>              Name or ID of entity to update.

Options:
  --type <type>         Type of entity to update. Available resources are:
                        'volume', 'snapshot', 'backup', 'group' (since 3.20)
                        and 'group-snapshot' (since 3.19), Default=volume.
  --state <state>       The state to assign to the entity. NOTE: This command
                        simply changes the state of the entity in the database
                        with no regard to actual status, exercise caution when
                        using. Default=None, that means the state is
                        unchanged.
  --attach-status <attach-status>
                        This is only used for a volume entity. The attach
                        status to assign to the volume in the database, with
                        no regard to the actual status. Valid values are
                        "attached" and "detached". Default=None, that means
                        the status is unchanged.
  --reset-migration-status
                        This is only used for a volume entity. Clears the
                        migration status of the volume in the DataBase that
                        indicates the volume is source or destination of
                        volume migration, with no regard to the actual status.
