# Command: glance help image-download

usage: glance image-download [--allow-md5-fallback] [--file <FILE>]
                             [--progress]
                             <IMAGE_ID>

Download a specific image.

Positional arguments:
  <IMAGE_ID>            ID of image to download.

Options:
  --allow-md5-fallback  If os_hash_algo and os_hash_value properties are
                        available on the image, they will be used to validate
                        the downloaded image data. If the indicated secure
                        hash algorithm is not available on the client, the
                        download will fail. Use this flag to indicate that in
                        such a case the legacy MD5 image checksum should be
                        used to validate the downloaded data. You can also set
                        the environment variable OS_IMAGE_ALLOW_MD5_FALLBACK
                        to any value to activate this option.
  --file <FILE>         Local file to save downloaded image data to. If this
                        is not specified and there is no redirection the image
                        data will not be saved.
  --progress            Show download progress bar.
